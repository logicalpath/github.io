title: "Using SMolVLM to describe photos"
---

I used this vm recipe after reading this Simon Willison [post](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/28/smolvlm/){:target="_blank"}.

uv run \
  --with mlx-vlm \
  --with torch \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/SmolVLM-Instruct-bf16 \
    --max-tokens 500 \
    --temp 0.5 \
    --prompt "Describe this image in detail" \
    --image test.jpg

Here is the image I used:

![pic]({{site.url}}/images/test.jpg)

Here is the output:

Prompt: <|im_start|>User:<image>Describe this image in detail<end_of_utterance>

Assistant:

 A wide shot of a rocky beach and ocean. The sky is clear with no clouds in sight, and the water is very blue and calm. There are some small waves breaking on the shore.



Prompt: 4.950 tokens-per-sec
Generation: 34.796 tokens-per-sec
